# Blink-1470
CSCI 1470 Final Project

References:
The main reference for this project is the public implementation of the interpretable CNN paper we are following: https://github.com/andrehuang/InterpretableCNN
As discussed with our TA, we will only referencing it in line with Final Project Guidelines:
a) We are using Tensorflow 2 and Keras rather than Tensorflow 1.
b) we are applying the model to a different dataset (spectrograms rather than visual images)

Another source of possible references for our project are these Kaggle notebooks: https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification/notebooks. We do not plan on referencing these for our project, but have listed them here for transparency, since our dataset is somewhat commmon.
